<h2>Captain Smart has finally broken his silence</h2>
  <p>Captain Smart has finally broken his silence on his suspension from Angel FM as the morning show host.
  In an interview with Paul Adom Otchere on the Good Evening Ghana show on Thursday, May 6, 2021,
   Captain Smart explained what led to his suspension. He revealed that the owner of the station,
    Dr Kwaku Oteng, said in a conversation that he had been told that he (Captain) had insulted
     President Nana Akufo-Addo, his vice, Dr Mahamudu Bawumia, and Alan Kyerematen.

UGC He told Oteng that the information was false and even declared his intention to apologise on-air 
if evidence was brought that he (Captain) called those people fools as being alleged.

  names 4 people he offended in new video Notwithstanding his explanation to his boss,
   Captain Smart said he was asked to step aside after the day's show. According to him,
    Oteng intimated that there was pressure on him from the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA)
     and other government agencies because of the supposed insults. "He (Oteng) thus told me to stay away 
     until such a time the pressure will cool off," Captain Smart said. Earlier, Captain Smart had indicated
      that he was not afraid to lose his job and would have gladly left if he had been told to resign. 
      "If he had called to tell me, Captain, I cannot work with you again. I would have had no problem 
      because I will not go hungry. My brain works," he said. Reports surfaced on social media on Thursday,
       May 6, 2021, that Captain Smart had been taken off the airwaves. The reports were started by a post
        on the Facebook page of IMANI President, Franklin Cudjoe. Cudjoe had indicated that his sources
         had told him Captain Smart had been taken off air for overly criticising President Nana Akufo-Addo's
          government.
